<h1>About</h1>
<a href="index.html"><img src="images/placeholder.png" alt="Jerry Bowen Logo" width="300" height="500"><br>
<a>My name is Jerry Bowen and I am a freelance photographer as well as a student at the University of South Carolina.
I first started photography in high school at Clover High School for the yearbook. Since then, I had fallen in love with photography and wanted to pursue it and share my love of photography with others.
At USC, I study Integrated Information Technology at the College of Engineering and Computing. I have always had a passion for technology and computers so it was so fitting and reliving when I found a major that fit to what I wanted to do with my life.</a>
